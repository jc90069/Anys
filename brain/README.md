# Anys Brain

> Central knowledge base for Anys personal assistant.
> Read these files to understand everything about the user.

## Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `stack.md` | All APIs, services, credentials, billing |
| `me.md` | Personal preferences, likes/dislikes, goals |
| `projects.md` | All projects and their status |

## How to Use

1. **At conversation start**: Read all files to get full context
2. **During conversation**: Reference relevant sections
3. **After learning something new**: Add to appropriate file

## Alerts

Anys should proactively flag:
- API billing issues or unusual spending
- Approaching service limits
- Security concerns (exposed keys, etc.)
- Project blockers or stale work
